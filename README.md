# The Project
A genetic algorithm written using Fortran. The program evaluates the optimal initial velocity vector to launch a projectile to hit a user-specified target, within a simulated environment involving gravity and air resistance.

It is recommended to take a brief look at the .f90 code, and to observe the .pdf file that describes the progress made in this project.

## How to run the script

To run this script, you will need to download the file and then compile it using a Fortran compiler, such as:
* gfortran
* nagfor

# Jupyter Notebook

I will consider adding a Jupyter Notebook that uses the Coarray-Fortran kernel, to better illustrate how the Fortran script works.
